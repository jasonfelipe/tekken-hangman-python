# Tekken Hangman
A Hangman game using Python with a Tekken Theme! 

My first small Python project started in late November 2018. 

## Requirements to Run
Please install Python 3.7.1 
After this, in your terminal of choice, navigate 
to the appropriate folder (this game's folder) 
and input the following: 
```
python hangman.py
``` 
The game should run. Enjoy!
